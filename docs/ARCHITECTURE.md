# StudySync Architecture

## Overview
StudySync is built using Next.js 13+ with the App Router, TypeScript, and Supabase for backend services. The application follows a component-based architecture with clear separation between client and server components.

## Directory Structure
```
app/
├── components/     # React components
│   ├── documents/ # Document management components
│   └── ui/        # Reusable UI components
├── contexts/      # React context providers
├── hooks/         # Custom React hooks
├── types/         # TypeScript type definitions
└── utils/         # Utility functions
```

## Key Components

### Document Management
- `TopicList`: Manages document organization and movement between topics
- `DocumentOperationsContext`: Handles document operations state and animations
- `ProgressRing`: Provides visual feedback for document operations

### State Management
- React Context for global state
- Local component state using hooks
- Supabase real-time subscriptions for data sync

## Animation System
The application uses a combination of Framer Motion and custom animations:
- Progress indicators with directional feedback
- Smooth transitions for document operations
- Visual confirmation states

## Data Flow
1. User initiates document operation
2. Context updates operation state
3. Visual feedback through animations
4. Backend sync with Supabase
5. UI updates with operation result

## Performance Considerations
- Code splitting for optimal bundle size
- Lazy loading of components
- Optimized animations for smooth performance
- Efficient state management
